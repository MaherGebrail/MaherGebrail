- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MaherGebrail

 - Born in 1994, Graduated from Electronics & Communication Engineering ... generally, Interested in philosophy, psychology and of-course coding [since it's not a secret â€¦ Machines aren't more interesting than Human's Behavior :grin: while machines are better in logic :sweat_smile:].

\- _I See you noticed that I have already written my interests, generally â€¦ I would prefer gladly from you to act like you haven't noticed that â€¦ While reading the next phrase :sweat_smile:_ \-

- I found that GitHub wanted me to write something that I'm interested in â€¦ but guess what â€¦ I am a young in a big universe !! â€¦ Which makes it need a full book of wondering â€¦ That makes me not even be able to gather a clear point to start writing from â€¦ As I've said â€¦ I'm young â€¦ As any human \- as I think \- .

:hand: yes yes, sorry â€¦ I forgot to mention that I'm an author too :bowtie:.

Well â€¦ It seems that we finished here :grin: ... ðŸ‘‹
